///
/// do_with() takes two arguments: The first is an temporary object (rvalue),
/// the second is a function returning a future (a so-called "promise").
/// The function is given (a moved copy of) this temporary object, by
/// reference, and it is ensured that the object will not be destructed until
/// the completion of the future returned by the function.

/// contain references to the temporary object, as at that point the temporary
/// is destructed.
