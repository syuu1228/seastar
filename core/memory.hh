/// \defgroup memory-module Memory management
///
/// Functions and classes for managing memory.
///
/// Memory management in seastar consists of the following:
///
///   - Low-level memory management in the \ref memory namespace.
///   - Various smart pointers: \ref shared_ptr, \ref lw_shared_ptr,
///     and \ref foreign_ptr.
///   - zero-copy support: \ref temporary_buffer and \ref deleter.

/// Low-level memory management support
///
/// The \c memory namespace provides functions and classes for interfacing
/// with the seastar memory allocator.
///
/// The seastar memory allocator splits system memory into a pool per
/// logical core (lcore).  Memory allocated one an lcore should be freed
/// on the same lcore; failing to do so carries a severe performance
/// penalty.  It is possible to share memory with another core, but this
/// should be limited to avoid cache coherency traffic.
